# R-Primers 

The goal of this project is to create a well-cataloged scripts (templates), so users can start a project with R quickly even when we are not (currently) familiar with R. 

## How to use?

If you have R (and Rstudio) installed and used it before, you can maybe find what you need in the **task-based primers**.

If you are totally new, see **Before any analysis** below and start with installing.

### Before any analysis
Installing R, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/), and learn basics in R: go to the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) website and follow the instructions.

 For each project we will [set up working environment](Documents/Set_up_working.md), this is espetially important when we work on multiple machine, or work with a team. Also, some basics of [working in Rstudio](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/blob/master/Documents/Working_with_Rstudio.md) and [working with scripts and .R files](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/blob/master/Documents/Working_with_scripts.md). 
 
 With these skills you should be able to play through the examples in [Basic utility](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-basic-utilities), and learn R at your own pace. 

 Or you might try a **top-down method**, start working on a [Task-Based Primers](https://github.com/weitingwlin/r-primers/tree/master/Documents#catalog-of-task-based-projects), and click-learn everything you need on the way.

Basic tips of R programing and How-To, including examples. This would be the knowladge base of the **Task-Based Primers**.  

Each topics is small, and linked with other topics.
