# R-Primers 


The goal of this project is to create a well-cataloged scripts (templates), so users can start a project with R quickly even when we are not (currently) familiar with R. 

## How to use?

If you have R (and Rstudio) installed and used it before, you can maybe find what you need in the **task-based primers**.

If you are totally new, see **Before any analysis** below and start with installing.

**Basic utility** will be the archive for the scripts, examples of small tasks you might need. 

### Before any analysis
Installing R, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/), and learn basics in R: go to the [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) website and follow the instructions.

 For each project we will [set up working environment](Documents/Set_up_working.md), this is espetially important when we work on multiple machine, or work with a team.
     
 Also, some basics of [working with .R files](Documents\Working_with_scripts.md). 
 
 Load data (from text, excel, ...), and preparing the data to be loaded.
