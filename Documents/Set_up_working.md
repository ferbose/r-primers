## Set up working environment

Give each project a folder (or "directory"), let's call it  **project folder**. In the folder, there should be a **ReadMe file** (e.g. ReadMe.md) that keeps a record for all the rest files and folders.

**Data** can be put in a seperate folder (maybe called "data").

The **R scripts** (.R files) will be kept in this project folder. 

* make each script small
* use [**relative path**](https://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtsearch/relative_paths.htm) to get data 

## working with multiple machine
In different machine (either you are synching Dropbox, or flash drive ect.) the pro.


Once you are working in the project folder. 

`source("")`
